Solidarity ideas:

- Horseshoe turn structure?
- Attack hit percentage?
- Health? Building's take two attacks?
- Allow workers to build buildings ($3 mil?)
- Multiple actions per turn (per unit)?
- Units of different attack range, health, or movement distance
- Some units are extra strong against certain units (hard counters)?
- "Strike" moment/option for workers' team? (all organizers are revealed, and stop taking orders)
- Different terrain types? Terrain info box that also displays info of object on that spot would be nice.
- Highlight around units who can still act this turn
- Black out screen while waiting for next player to sit down and press 'OK'
- Save game option (and autosave?)
- 4-player mode?
- Networking! Also a board game!
